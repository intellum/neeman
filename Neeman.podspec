The idea behind Neeman is to help you easily create a usable Hibrid app from an existing web app. 
It does this without getting in your way of adding additional native functionality. Try it out with your web app embeded in a native navigation stack. 
You can then see if you need to reimplement certain features natively. The best way to save development time and still maintain a beautify user experience 
is to keep your content rendered with HTML and implement your navigation natively.

## Getting Started
1. Create an Xcode project with the template best suiting your app.
2. Make one of your view controllers a WebViewController.
3. Set the **User Defined Runtime Attribute** `rootURLString` to the URL you which to display.
